1. Introduction:
Name of the Project: "GoType" – A typing speed project.
Objective: GoType helps users improve their typing speed by allowing them to practice typing, calculate their speed in words per minute (WPM), and track progress over time.

2. Features:
Real-time Typing Speed Calculation: "The app dynamically captures user input and calculates typing speed and accuracy in real time using JavaScript event handling. This ensures the user gets instant feedback on their performance."
User Progress Tracking: "We integrated a database (MongoDB) or local storage to store users’ best typing speed records and display their progress over time. This feature motivates users to continually improve."

3. Technologies Used:
Frontend: "I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface and handle user input. Event handling in JavaScript was crucial for capturing keystrokes and calculating typing speed."
Backend: "On the server side, I used Node.js and Express.js to manage the application logic. The backend also interacts with a MongoDB database, where user data such as best scores and typing history are stored."
Templating Engine: "For rendering dynamic content, I utilized EJS to display typing statistics and user progress."

4. Your Role:
Development: "I was responsible for the full development cycle. I designed the interface, implemented the typing speed calculation logic, and managed the backend setup to handle user data storage."
Challenges & Solutions: "One of the challenges was handling real-time typing data efficiently. I solved this by optimizing the event listeners and ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend and backend."

5. Impact:
User Feedback: "GoType helps users improve their typing speed while tracking their progress, which enhances their engagement."
Scalability: "The use of MongoDB allows the system to scale and support multiple users, keeping their records intact."
6. Conclusion:
"This project improved my skills in full-stack development, event handling, and database management. It also gave me insights into performance optimization for real-time applications."
